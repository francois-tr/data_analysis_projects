After exploring the entire data set and with some calculations we were able to figure out two keys indicators showing us if a customer will leave or not :

If the ratio fall under 0.11 on consecutive months, the client is at risk to leave
If the number of transaction fall under 7.15 by months, the client is also at risk

And we also found something interesting to help him keep his customers, since we saw that a customer with more than 2 products have an higher tendancy to stay in the bank. Therefore selling more products to them could help him keep his customers.
